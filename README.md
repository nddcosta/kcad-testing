A testing script I wrote that was used to measure the performance of machine learning models in detecting simulated kinematic cyber attacks on an additive manufacturing machines.
The paper explored the possibility of utilizing side channel emissions from a 3D printer such as acoustics, vibrations, etc. to determine if the printed part does
in fact coincide with the G-Code that is creating it. The results from these tests can be found in paper <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8984311">here</a>.
I also created a demo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifOovz1pl1c&ab_channel=AICPS">video</a> for the research.
